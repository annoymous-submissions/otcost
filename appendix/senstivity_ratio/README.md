## Sensitivity to cost ratios

This folder contains the results and figures for the **sensitivity analysis of the feature and label cost weighting** ($w_f:w_l$) as discussed in Section "D.c Dataset Similarity Metric: Total Per-Label Cost Matrix"

Specifically, the included `.png` images illustrate the impact of varying the `w_f:w_l` ratio on our proposed metric. These figures visually demonstrate the robustness of our method across a range of weighting configurations, from a dominant feature cost ($4:1$) to a dominant label cost ($1:4$), as mentioned in the text:
